<h2>Text that is to be included as content in documents is cleaned
(escaped) to prevent errors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is for fixing up "untrusted text" that is to be passed into a
file as content. It protects against "bad" text strings in 3
contexts, 1) LaTeX documents, 2) HTML documents, or 3) text in a
file name. It converts content text to an improved string that
will not cause failures in the eventual document.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">escape(x, type = "tex")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a string, or vector of strings (each of which is
processed separately)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>"tex" is default, could be "filename" or "html"</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The special in-document LaTeX symbols like percent sign or dollar sign
are "
session, these will appear as double-backslashed symbols, while in
a saved text file, there will only be the one desired slash.
</p>
<p>If type = "html", we only clean up &lt;, &gt;, / and &amp;, and quote
characters.  If document is in unicode, we don't need to do the
gigantic set anymore.
</p>
<p>If type = "filename", then symbols that are not allowed in file
names, such as "\", "*", are replaced. Do not use this on a
full path, since it will obliterate path separators.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>corrected character vector
