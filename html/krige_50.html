<h2>West Virginia Oil and Gas Production in 2012</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data are a subset of the West Virginia Geological and Economic Survey of 
2014. They contain information on the coordinates of wells that yielded at 
least some quantity of natural gas in 2012. In addition to coordinates, the 
data contain information on well ownership and operation, rock pressure at 
the well, elevation of the well, oil production, and gas production.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The <code>WVwells</code> dataset has 1949 observations and 18 variables.
</p>

<dd>
<p>A 10-digit number in the format assigned by the American 
Petroleum Institute (API), consisting of a 2-digit state code, a 3-digit county 
code with leading zeroes, and a 5-digit permit number with leading zeroes.

if deemed necessary.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>LatSrf</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Surface Location–Latitude: The well location at the surface 
measured to a precision of 6 decimal points, in degrees north of the equator. 
Data Source: Taken directly from the plat if given as such. Otherwise, computed 
from the location reported on the plat. Suspect locations may be adjusted using 
various additional resources (e.g. topographic maps) if deemed necessary.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Elevation</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Elevation: The height of the well in feet above mean 
sea level. Data Source: WVDEP-OOG plat; verified on the WR-35 completion record.</p>

<dt><code>RockPres</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Formation Rock Pressure at Surface: The pressure measured 
at the surface usually after stimulation, in pounds per square inch (psi). 
Data Source: WVDEP-OOG WR-35 comp#'   letion record, submitted by the operator 
to WVDEP-OOG.</p>
