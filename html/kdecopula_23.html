<h2>Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data contain measurements on cells in suspicious lumps in a woman's
breast. Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle
aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell
nuclei present in the image. All samples are classified as either
<em>benign</em> or <em>malignant</em>.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>wdbc</code> is a <code>data.frame</code> with 31 columns. The first column
indicates whether the sample is classified as benign (<code>B</code>) or malignant
(<code>M</code>). The remaining columns contain measurements for 30 features.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: <br></p>
<p>a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) <br> b)
texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) <br> c) perimeter <br> d)
area <br> e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) <br> f)
compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) <br> g) concavity (severity of concave
portions of the contour) <br> h) concave points (number of concave portions
of the contour) <br> i) symmetry <br> j) fractal dimension ("coastline
approximation" - 1) <br></p>
<p>The references listed below contain detailed descriptions of how these
features are computed.
</p>
<p>The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest
values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30
features.
</p>

<p>This breast cancer database was obtained from the University of
Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg.
