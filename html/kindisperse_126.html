<h2>Simulate kin dispersal distance pairs with composite sigmas</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulates intergenerational dispersal made up of composite dispersal stages in a species with a defined breeding and dispersal
structure similar to that of <em>Ae. aegypti</em> - i.e. with initial, breeding, gravid &amp; ovipositional dispersal phases,
approximately non-overlapping life cycles, and defined sampling points.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is one of a family of functions that implement the core intergenerational dispersal simulations
contained in the <code>kindisperse</code> package. Each of these functions proceeds by the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> identify the pedigree
relationship, dispersal phase (FS, HS &amp; PO) and sampling stage that must be generated;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> randomly assign a coordinate position
to the 'root' individual within the pedigree (i.e. last common ancestor of the dyad, inclusive);
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 'disperse' both pathways from
this root position via the appropriately defined phase dispersal (additively via random draws from the underlying statistical
model, defined by an axial standard deviation - sigma);
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> further disperse both phased descendant branches according to the
number of realised breeding dispersal cycles contained in the defining pedigree (additively via random draws from the chosen
underlying statistical model);
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> add displacement caused by dispersal before the sampling point in a similar manner to above,
defining the final positions of the sampled dispersed kin dyads;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> calculating geographical distances between the
resulting dyads.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These simulation functions operate under an additive variance framework: all individual dispersal events are modeled as random
draws from a bivariate probability distribution defined by an axial standard deviation <code>sigma</code> and (sometimes) a shape
parameter. At present, three such distributions are included as options accessible with the <code>method</code> parameter: the
bivariate normal distribution '<code>Gaussian</code>', the bivariate Laplace distribution '<code>Laplace</code>', and the bivariate
variance-gamma distribution '<code>vgamma</code>'. The <code>Gaussian</code> (normal) distribution enables easy compatibility with the
framework under which much population genetic &amp; dispersal theory (isolation by distance, neighbourhoods, etc.) have been
developed. The <code>Laplace</code> distribution is a multivariate adaptation of the (positive) exponential distribution, and
represents a more 'fat-tailed' (leptokurtic) disperal situation than Gaussian. The <code>vgamma</code> distribution is a mixture
distribution formed by mixing the gamma distribution with the bivariate normal distribution. The flexibility of this
distribution's <code>shape</code> parameter enables us to model arbitrarily leptokurtic dispesal kernels, providing a helpful way
to examine the impacts of (e.g.) long distance dispersal on the overall disperal distribution and sampling decisions. A
<code>vgamma</code> distribution with shape parameter equal to 1 reduces to the bivariate Laplace distribution. As shape approaches
infinity, the <code>vgamma</code> distribution approaches the bivariate normal distribution. As shape approaches zero, the distribution
becomes increasingly leptokurtic.
</p>
<p>The <code>simulate_kindist_composite()</code> function is designed to enable modeling of the composite dispersal events that occur
<strong>within</strong> the breeding cycle of an organism, and enables the separate treatment of the <code>PO, FS</code>, and <code>HS</code>
phases (where, for example, the final distributions of full and half siblings are different in contexts where males mate
with multiple females but females primarily carry the offspring of one male). This function has been designed primarily in the
context of modelling dispersal in the mosquito <em>Ae. aegypti</em>; parameter names and the structure of kinship phases
reflect a single-generational breeding organism with an initial dispersal phase, a mating phase (where HS individuals branch),
a gravid phase, and an oviposition phase (where FS individuals branch). The sampling options ('immature' &amp; 'ovipositional')
also reflect common mosquito trapping methods (i.e. ovitraps &amp; gravitraps) which both target individuals dispersing in the
defined oviposition phase. This function should be easily adaptable to a vast number of other animals, especially insects, where
breeding occurs in one generation and parameters such as this hold. For slightly more complex scenarios (multiple breeding cycles,
differing sample points, more or less dispersal components making up a lifespan, different FS/HS branchpoints, etc.), the
enhanced capabilities of the <code>simulate_kindist_custom</code> function may be required.
</p>
<p>Following simulation, the results are returned as an object of the specially defined package class <code>KinPairSimulation</code>,
which stores the simulation results along with information about all simulation parameters, and can be further passed to
sample filtering &amp; dispersal estimation functions.
