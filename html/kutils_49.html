<h2>Insert 0's in the front of existing digits or characters so that
all elements of a vector have the same number of characters.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The main purpose was to correct ID numbers in studies that are
entered as integers with leading 0's as in 000001 or 034554.  R's
default coercion of integers will throw away the preceding 0's,
and reduce that to 1 or 34554. The user might want to re-insert
the 0's, thereby creating a character vector with values "000001"
and "045665".
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">padW0(x, n = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector to be converted to a character variable by
inserting 0's at the front. Should be integer or character,
floating point numbers will be rounded down. All other
variable types will return errors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional parameter.  The desired final length of
character vector.  This parameter is a guideline to determine
how many 0's must be inserted.  This will be ignored if
<code>n</code> is smaller than the number of characters in the
longest element of <code>x</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If x is an integer or a character vector, the result is the
more-or-less expected outcome (see examples). If x is numeric,
but not an integer, then x will be rounded to the lowest integer.
</p>
<p>The previous versions of this function failed when there were
missing values (NA) in the vector x.  This version returns NA for
those values.
</p>
<p>One of the surprises in this development was that sprintf() in R
does not have a known consequence when applied to a character
variable. It is platform-dependent (unredictable). On Ubuntu Linux
16.04, for example <code>sprintf("%05s", 2)</code> gives back
<code>" 2"</code>, rather than (what I expected) <code>"00002"</code>. The
problem is mentioned in the documentation for <code>sprintf</code>. The
examples show this does work now, but please test your results.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">x1 &lt;- c(0001, 0022, 3432, NA)
padW0(x1)
padW0(x1, n = 10)
x2 &lt;- c("1", "22", "3432", NA)
padW0(x2)
## There's been a problem with strings, but this works now.
## It even preserves non-leading spaces. Hope that's what you want.
x3 &lt;- c("1", "22 4", "34323  42", NA)
padW0(x3)
x4 &lt;- c(1.1, 334.52, NA)
padW0(x4)
</code></pre>
