<h2>Fast K-mer Counting and Clustering for Biological Sequence Analysis.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The kmer package contains tools for rapidly computing
distance matrices, building large trees, and clustering
operational taxonomic units using fast alignment-free
k-mer counting and divisive clustering techniques.
</p>


<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>A breif description of the primary <span class="pkg">kmer</span> functions are
provided with links to their help pages below.
</p>


<h3>K-mer counting</h3>


<ul><li> <p><code>kcount</code> counts all k-letter words in a
sequence or set of sequences using a sliding window of
length k
</p>
</li></ul>
<h3>Distance matrix computation</h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>kdistance</code> calculates pairwise
distances between sequences based on k-mer counts
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>mbed</code> embeds sequences as vectors of
k-mer distances to a set of seed' sequences
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alignment-free clustering</h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>cluster</code> builds a phylogenetic tree by
successively splitting a set of sequences
(recursive partitioning) based on k-mer counts
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>otu</code> heirarchically clusters a set of sequences
until a predefined furthest neighbor dissimilarity threshold is reached.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
