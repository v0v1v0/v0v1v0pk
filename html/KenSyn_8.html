<h2>Network of experiment to evaluate Wheat varieties on one single year.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data set consists of measurements of wheat yields from a network of field experiments
designed to evaluate and compare performances of 10 different varieties (v1 to v10).
It contains 5 different experiments (experiment 1 to 5) corresponding to five different places.The choice of places
was made so that they are representative of the variability observed in the study area.
All the experiments took place in the same year.
The experimental designs used are complete random block designs.
The number of repetitions in each experiment is equal to three (block 1 to 3).
