indegree, outdegree, and (total) degree respectively. <code>"all"</code> reports
all the above measures. The default is to report the total degree.
Note for closeness centrality, we use the Gil-Schmidt power index when <code>large=FALSE</code>.

large=<code>TRUE</code>, the function reports the standard closeness score.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The basic idea of measuring the group-level centrality is to treat
a group of nodes as a large pseudo-node. We propose several methods to measure
the tie status between this pseudo node and other nodes, responding to several
common edge value interpretations (An and Liu, 2015).
</p>
<p>Minimum Criterion: the edge value between a group and an outside node
is measured as the minimal value among all the (nonzero) edge values between
any node in the group and the outside node. Suggested if edge values are
interpreted as distances.<br><em>Example: suppose node A to C has distance 2 and B to C has distance 1,
then according to the minimum criterion, the distance between C and
the merged set AB is 1. Note that if B and C are not connected,
the algorithm takes the distance between A and C to describe
the distance between AB and C.</em>
</p>
<p>Maximun Criterion: the edge value between a group and an outside node
is measured as the maximal value among all the (nonzero) edge values between
any node in the group and the outside node. Suggested if edge values are
interpreted as non-cummulative strengths. <br><em>Example: we keep using the above example, but the figure now indicates
the strength of tie. According to the maximum criterion, the strength of tie
between AB and C is 2.</em>
</p>
<p>Addition Criterion: the edge value between a group and an outside node
is measured as the sum of all the edge values between any node in the group
and the outside node. Suggested if edge values are as cummulative strengths. <br><em>Example: according to the addition criterion, the strength of tie between
AB and C is 3</em>
</p>
<p>Union Criterion: the edge value between a group and an outside node is measured
as the probability that there is at least one path connecting the group with
the outside node. Suggested if edge values are as probability. <br><em>Example: suppose A has probability 0.2 to reach C and B has probability
0.5 to reach C, then C can be reached from merged AB with probability
1-(1-0.2)*(1-0.5)=0.6 according to the union criterion.</em>
