<h2>Update packages, spot new dependencies, and install them</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Addresses the problem that updates for previously installed R
packages may insert new dependencies. R's update.packages does not
trigger the installation of packages that are added as new
requirements in existing packages.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">updatePackages(
  ask = FALSE,
  checkBuilt = TRUE,
  dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo"),
  libnew = "/usr/share/R/library/",
  repos = options("repos"),
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ask</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, asks user to select packages to update</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>checkBuilt</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, packages built under earlier versions
of R are to be considered 'old'</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dependencies</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector specifying which type of dependencies
need to be taken into account. We default to c("Depends",
"Imports", "LinkingTo").</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>libnew</code></td>
<td>
<p>The R library folder into which the new packages
must be installed.  Defaults to "/usr/share/R/library", which
is where EL7 likes those things.  To install packages in
personal user directory, put libnew = NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>repos</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of repositories on which to search for
packages. Same definition as in R's install.packages or
install.packages.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>additional arguments passed to update.packages and
install.packages</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function checks for existence of updates, ascertains whether
those packages impose new requirements, and installs any new
requirements. Then it conducts the update.
</p>
<p>This function is valuable in system maintenance because sometimes
existing packages adopt new requirements and the update.packages
function does not notice.  Another possible case would be that a user
accidentally deletes some packages without realizing other packages
depend on them.
</p>
<p>If this is run as the root/administrator privileged, then base R
packages may be updated, but if user is not root/administrator,
there will be a warning that packages were not updated because
permissions were lacking. For example
</p>
<p>"Warning: package 'boot' in library '/usr/lib/R/library' will not
be updated.
</p>
<p>This warning does not interfere with rest of purpose of this
function, since the new dependencies can be installed in a place
where the user has privileges, either by specifying libnew as a
full directory name or by setting it to NULL, which puts new
packages in $R_LIBS_USER
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of new packages being installed

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
myrepos &lt;- c("http://rweb.crmda.ku.edu/cran",
             "http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.3/bioc")
updatePackages(repos = myrepos)
## libnew defaults to "/usr/share/R/library". Specify NULL
## so that new packages will go to user's directory
updatePackages(libnew = NULL)

## End(Not run)
