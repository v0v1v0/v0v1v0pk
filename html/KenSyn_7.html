<h2>Wheat Yield at a regional scale (fake data).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Wheat yield.
The data set consists of 45 measurements of wheat yields from 15 experimental sites (one year) in a fictive agricultural region.
In this dataset, a study represents a site-year with 2 to 4 blocks.
Each block corresponds to an experimental plot on which the yield of the crop (expressed in t.ha-1) was measured.
Thus, each study contains 2 to 4 measurements of yields
