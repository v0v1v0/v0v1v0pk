makeGlobal is a vector containing the variables to declare global.It is used internally. <br>
KTSEnv is the environment where the loaded data sets are and it can be accesed directly from the R console. We reccomend to use KarsTS to manipulate the data sets; however, the user can handle them directly from R in order to apply functionalities not included in KarsTS. If that is the case, be careful to produce data sets with the right format; otherwise, KarsTS will not recognize them. See the User's Guide for more information.
