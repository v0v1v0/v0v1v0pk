<h2>sets and fixes knitr hooks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>fixes a well-known bug in the knit_hook 'chunk' and provides a hook entitle
'com'
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">knitr_sethooks()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There is a well_known bug in the knit_hook 'chunk' which prevents using
results = 'asis' in conjunction with user-defined hooks (including com, to be
discussed next). Calling this function allows user-defined hooks to be called
with results = 'asis' and get the expected result. This function also
provides a knitr hook called 'com', by setting 'com = TRUE' in a knitr chunk,
the resulting code is converted to a latex command. For example:
'&lt;&lt;mytable, com=TRUE&gt;&gt;=' results in a latex command entitled '\mytable', which will
produce the exact output that would have appeared in the spot of the chunk
