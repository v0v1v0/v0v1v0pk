<h2>Sentence tokenizer</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Extract sentences from a batch of text lines.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">tknz_sent(input, EOS = "[.?!:;]+", keep_first = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>input</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>EOS</code></td>
<td>
<p>a regular expression matching an End-Of-Sentence delimiter.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep_first</code></td>
<td>
<p>TRUE or FALSE? Should the first character of the matches
be appended to the returned sentences (with a space)?</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>tknz_sent()</code> splits text into sentences, where sentence delimiters are
specified by a regular expression through the <code>EOS</code> argument.
Specifically, when an EOS token is found, the next sentence begins at the
first position in the input string not containing any of the EOS tokens
<em>or white space</em> (so that entries like <code>"Hi there!!!"</code> or
<code>"Hello . . ."</code> are both recognized as a single sentence).
</p>
<p>If <code>keep_first</code> is <code>FALSE</code>, the delimiters are stripped off from
the returned sequences. Otherwise, the first character of the substrings
matching the <code>EOS</code> regular expressions are appended to the corresponding
sentences, preceded by a white space.
</p>
<p>In the absence of any <code>EOS</code> delimiter, <code>tknz_sent()</code>
returns the input as is, since parts of text corresponding to different
entries of the input vector <code>x</code> are understood as parts of separate
sentences.
</p>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> This function, as well as preprocess, are included
in the library for illustrative purposes only, and are not optimized for
performance. Furthermore (for performance reasons) the function has a
separate implementation for Windows and UNIX OS types, respectively, so that
results obtained in the two cases may differ slightly.
In contexts that require full reproducibility, users are encouraged to define
their own preprocessing and tokenization custom functions - or to work with
externally processed data.

<h3>Value</h3>

sentence.
