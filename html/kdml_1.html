<h2>Kernel Metric Learning for Mixed-type Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package contains nonparametric kernel methods for calculating pairwise 
distances between mixed-type observations. These methods can be used in any 
distance based algorithm, with emphasis placed on usage in clustering or 
classification applications. Descriptions of the implementation of these methods
can be found in Ghashti (2024) and Ghashti and Thompson (2024).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package contains two functions for pairwise distance calculations of 
mixed-type data based on two different methods. Kernel methods also require 
variable-specific bandwidths, with two additional functions for the bandwidth 
specification methods. Additionally, this package contains a function methods 
for mixed-type data generation.
