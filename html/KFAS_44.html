<h2>Defunct Functions of Package KFAS</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function listed here are removed from KFAS.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'KFS'
deviance(object, ...)

## S3 replacement method for class 'SSModel'
subset(x, element, states, etas, series, times, ...) &lt;- value

subset(x, ...) &lt;- value

## S3 method for class 'SSModel'
subset(x, element, states, etas, series, times, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Subset-based methods were removed as they were somewhat confusingly
named as the <code>subset</code> generic in <code>base</code>, and most likely not
that useful (compared to <code>[&lt;-.SSModel</code>).
</p>
<p>Deviance.KFS was removed as it was mostly useless. The value was not a <code class="reqn">-2*(logL-logL*)</code>
where <code class="reqn">L</code> is the likelihood and <code class="reqn">L*</code> is the saturated likelihood.
Instead it was based on the conditional likelihood <code class="reqn">p(y|theta)</code> i.e. it disregards
the effect of hidden states. Therefore the value
returned by this function did not make much sense in non-GLM setting.
</p>
<p>From <code>rstandard.KFS</code> and <code>residuals.KFS</code>: Computation of deviance residuals. 
This option was meant to be used only for the GLM comparisons, as their 
generalization to other models is lacking, but in order to avoid misleading 
results in non-GLM settings, these are now completely removed.
