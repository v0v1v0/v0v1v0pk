<h2>
Mixed-type Data Generation with True Membership Labels
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates a mixed-type data frame with a combination of continuous
(<code>numeric</code>), nominal (<code>factor</code>), and  ordinal (<code>ordered</code>) 
variables with prespecified cluster overlap for each variable type. 
<code>confactord</code> allows the user to specify the number of each 
variable type, the amount of variables per variable type that have cluster 
overlap, the amount of cluster overlap for each variable type, the number of 
levels for the nominal and ordinal variables, and proportion of observations 
per class membership. Within and across-type variables are generated 
independently from one another. Currently, only two classes are may be generated.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">confactord(n = 200, 
            popProb = c(0.5,0.5), 
            numMixVar = c(1,1,1), 
            numMixVarOl = c(1,1,1),  
            olVarType = c(0.1,0.1,0.1), 
            catLevels = c(2,4))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>

<p>integer number of observations to be generated. Defaults to <code>n = 200</code>
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>popProb</code></td>
<td>

<p>numeric vector of length two specifying the proportion of observations 
allocated to each class membership, which must sum to one. Defaults to 
<code>popProb = c(0.5, 0.5)</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>numMixVar</code></td>
<td>

<p>numeric vector of integers of length three specifying (in order) the total 
number of continuous (numeric), nominal (factor), and ordinal (ordered) 
variables to be generated. If a specific variable type is not required, 
set the appropriate vector indice to zero. Defaults to 
<code>numMixVar = c(1,1,1)</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>numMixVarOl</code></td>
<td>

<p>numeric vector of integers of length three specifying (in order) the total 
number of continuous (numeric), nominal (factor), and ordinal (ordered) 
variables that will have class membership overlap. If all variables are to
be well-separated by class membership, set all indices to zero. No indice 
of this vector may be greater than the corresponding indice in 
<code>numMixVar</code>. Defaults to <code>numMixVarOl = c(1,1,1)</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>olVarType</code></td>
<td>

<p>numeric vector of length three specifying (in order) the percentage of class 
membership overlap to be applied to the continuous (numeric), nominal 
(factor), and ordinal (ordered) No argument required if 
<code>numMixVarOl = c(0,0,0)</code>. Permissible class membership overlap per 
variable type is between 0.01 and 0.99. Defaults to ten percent overlap per
variable type, <code>olVarType = c(0.1,0.1,0.1)</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>catLevels</code></td>
<td>

<p>numeric vector of length two specifying (in order) the number of levels 
(integer values) for each of the nominal (factor) and ordinal (ordered) 
variable types. Defaults to <code>catLevels = c(2,4)</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Continuous variables are generated independently from normal distributions, 
with means determined by true class membership. If overlap is specified, 
additional variance is introduced to simulate cluster overlap. Nominal 
variables are generated using Dirichlet distributions representing different 
population proportions. Ordinal variables are initially simulated as 
continuous variables and then discretized into ordered categories based on 
quantile distributions, similar to a latent class model where ordinal 
categories are inferred based on underlying continuous distributions and 
adjusted for cluster overlap parameters.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>confactord</code> returns a <code>list</code> object, with the
following components:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a <code>data.frame</code> of mixed variable types based on user-
specified parameters</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>class</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of integers specifying the true class memberships 
for the returned <code>data</code> data frame</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># EXAMPLE1: Default implementation generates the following
# 200 observations split into two clusters of equal size (100 observations each) 
# Three variables-- one of each numeric, factor, and ordered
# Each variable has ten percent cluster overlap
# Nominal variable is binary
# Ordinal variable has four levels

df1 &lt;- confactord()


# EXAMPLE2: 
# 500 observations; 100 observations in cluster one and 400 in cluster two 
# Three continuous variables, two nominal, one ordinal
# Only one continuous variable has cluster overlap
# All nominal and ordinal variables have cluster overlap
# Cluster overlap for continuous variable is twenty percent
# Cluster overlap for nominal variables are thirty percent
# Cluster overlap for ordinal variable is fourty percent
# Nominal variable has three levels, while ordinal has 5
