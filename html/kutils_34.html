<h2>Homogenize class values and create a long key by pooling variable
keys.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For long-format keys, this is one way to correct for errors in
"class_old" or "class_new" for common variables. For a long key
created by stacking together several long keys, or for a list of
long keys, this will try to homogenize the classes by using a
"highest common denominator" approach.  If one key has x1 as a
floating point, but another block of rows in the key has x1 as
integer, then class must be changed to floating point
(numeric). If another section of a key has x1 as a character, then
character becomes the class.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">keysPool(
  keylong = NULL,
  keysplit = NULL,
  classes = list(c("logical", "integer"), c("integer", "numeric"), c("ordered",
    "factor"), c("factor", "character")),
  colnames = c("class_old", "class_new"),
  textre = "TEXT$"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keylong</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of long keys, or just one long key,
presumably a result of rbinding several long keys.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keysplit</code></td>
<td>
<p>Not often needed for user-level code. A list of
key blocks, each of which is to be inspected and
homogenized. Not used if a keylong argument is provided.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>classes</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of vectors specifying legal promotions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>colnames</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either c("class_old","class_new), ""class_old", or
"class_new".  The former is the default.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>textre</code></td>
<td>
<p>A regular expression matching a column name to be
treated as character. Default matches any variable name ending
in "TEXT"</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Users might run keyTemplate on several data sets, arriving
at keys that need to be combined.  The long versions of the
keys can be stacked together by a function like <code>rbind</code>.
If the values class_old and class_new for a single variable are
inconsistent, then the "key stack" will fail the tests in keyCheck.
This function automates the process of fixing the class variables by
"promoting" classes where possible.
</p>
<p>Begin with a simple example.  In one data set, the value of x is
drawn from integers 1L, 2L, 3L, while in another set it is
floating values like 1.1, 2.2. After creating long format keys,
and stacking them together, the values of class_old will clash.
For x, we will observe both "integer" and "numeric" in the
class_old column.  In that situation, the class_old for all of the
rows under consideration should be set as "numeric".
</p>
<p>The promotion schemes are described by the variable classes, where
we have the most conservative changes first. The most destructive
change is when variables are converted from integer to character,
for example. The conservative conversion strategies are specified
in the classes variable, in which the last element in a vector
will be used to replace the preceeding classes.  For example,
c("ordered", "factor", "character") means that the class_old
values of "ordered" and "factor" will be replaced by "character".
</p>
<p>The conversions specified by classes are tried, in order.
1. logical -&gt; integer
2. integer -&gt; numeric
3. ordered -&gt; factor
</p>
<p>If their application fails to homogenize a vector, then class is
changed to "character". For example, when the value of class_old
observed is c("ordered", "numeric", "character"). In that case,
the class is promoted to "character", it is the least common
denominator.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A class-corrected version of the same format as the input,
either a long key or a list of key elements.
