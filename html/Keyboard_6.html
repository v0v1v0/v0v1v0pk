<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Keyboard design utilizes the posterior distributions of the toxicity and efficacy to guide dosage transition. To determine whether to escalate or de-escalate given the observed data at the current dose, we must generate a boundary table and a decision matrix. The boundary table requires a lower boundary and an upper boundary for both toxicity and efficacy and a decision matrix, which provides dose escalation or de-escalation suggestions.
</p>
<p>A Bayesian toxicity probability interval design from Yuan's group is used to determine the lower and upper boundaries for toxicity  based on the target toxicity rate.
</p>
<p>The boundaries for efficacy are calculated based on the efficacy failure rate, which is <code class="reqn">1-target.efficacy</code>.  The efficacy failure rate is defined as 1 - target.efficacy and  treated similarly to toxicity. The lower and upper boundaries for efficacy failure are determined using a Bayesian toxicity probability interval design.  To compute the lower and upper boundaries for efficacy, we use the following:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">efficacy.lower.boundary = 1 - efficacy.failure.upper.boundary</code>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">efficacy.upper.boundary = 1 - efficacy.failure.lower.boundary</code>
</p>

<p>There are 3 subintervals for toxicity:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> The low interval for toxicity is (0, toxicity.lower.boundary).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The moderate interval for toxicity is (toxicity.lower.boundary, toxicity.upper.boundary).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The high interval for toxicity is (toxicity.upper.boundary, 1).
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are 3 subintervals for efficacy:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> The low interval for efficacy is (0, efficacy.lower.boundary).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The moderate interval for efficacy is (efficacy.lower.boundary, efficacy.upper.boundary).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The high interval for efficacy is (efficacy.upper.boundary, 1).
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming that the toxicity probability is <code class="reqn">p_i</code> and the efficacy probability is <code class="reqn">q_i</code> at dose level i, the probability unit intervals for toxicity and efficacy can be partitioned in to subintervals (a, b) and (c,d). (a, b)  is a subinterval for toxicity probability and (c, d) is a subinterval for efficacy probability. (a, b) x (c,d) is a combination interval. 3 toxicity intervals and 3 efficacy intervals result in 9 combination intervals. Besides the target toxicity rate and the target efficacy rate, a matrix is required that contains 9 decisions for these 9 combination intervals ordered as ((low toxicity, low efficacy),(low toxicity, moderate efficacy),(low toxicity, high efficacy), (moderate toxicity, low efficacy),(moderate toxicity, moderate efficacy),(moderate toxicity, high efficacy),(high toxicity, low efficacy),(high toxicity, moderate efficacy),(high toxicity, high efficacy)).  Possible decisions are "E", "D","S". Decision "D" denotes de-escalation, so the next cohort of patients will be treated at the next lower dose level.  Decision "E" denotes escalation, so the next cohort of patients will be treated at the next higher dose level.  Decision "S" denotes stay, so the next cohort of patients will be treated at the current dose level.
</p>
<p>Shown here is an example of boundary tables designed using this method with a target toxicity rate of 0.2 and a target efficacy rate of 0.4:

<p>For example, the interval combination (0, 0.16) x (0.27,0.52) corresponds to a decision "S". This means that the next cohort of patients will be treated at the current dose level if the observed toxicity rate of current dose falls in (0, 0.16)  and the observed efficacy rate falls in (0.27,0.52) .
</p>
<p>Suppose that there are d doses in the trial and that the current dose is i. Define the number of patients as <code class="reqn">n_i</code>, the number of patients who experienced toxicity as <code class="reqn">x_i</code> and the number of responses as <code class="reqn">y_i</code>.  The trial data can be shown as follows:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">D= {(n_i, x_i, y_i), i = 1, ..., d}</code>
</p>

<p>Bayesian rule is used to calculate the joint unit probability mass (JUPM) for the toxicity and efficacy combination intervals. For a given combination interval, JUPM is calculated as follows:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">JUPM_{(a,b)}^{(c,d)} =Pr{p_j \in (a,b), q_j \in (c,d) | D} / (b-a)*(d-c) </code>
</p>

<p><code class="reqn">Pr{p_j \in (a,b), q_j \in (c,d) | D} </code> are the posterior probabilities of <code class="reqn">p_i</code> and <code class="reqn">q_i</code> falling in the subinterval (a,b) and (c,d).  Assume the prior for both <code class="reqn">p_i</code> and <code class="reqn">q_i</code> follows independent beta distributions <code class="reqn">beta(\alpha_p,\beta_p)</code> and <code class="reqn">beta(\alpha_q,\beta_q)</code> respectively. The posterior distributions for <code class="reqn">p_i</code> and <code class="reqn">q_i</code> are <code class="reqn">beta(\alpha_p + x_i,\beta_p + n_i - x_i)</code> and <code class="reqn">beta(\alpha_q + y_i,\beta_q + n_i - y_i)</code>. Using these posterior distributions, calculate the JUPM for all  16 combination intervals and find the winning combination interval (a*,b*) and (c*,d*), which achieves the largest JUPM. The decision that corresponds to this winning combination interval is used to treat the next cohort of patients.
</p>
<p>Two dose exclusion rules are applied in the trial design: safety rule and futility rule.
Safety rule:
if at least 3 patients have been treated at a given dose and given
the observed data indicate that the probability of the toxicity rate of
the current dose exceeding the target toxicity rate is more
than 95%, we eliminate the current and any higher dose from the trial to prevent
exposing future patients to with unacceptable high toxicity. The probability
threshold can be specified with <code>cutoff.eli.toxicity</code>. When a dose is
eliminated, the design recommends the next lower dose for treating the next cohort of
patients. If the lowest dose is overly toxic, then the trial terminates early and
no dose is selected as the OBD. This corresponds to a dose assignment of "DUT", which means de-escalation due to unacceptable high toxicity and excluding the current dose and any dose higher than this dose from the trial.
</p>
<p>Futility rule:
if at least 3 patients have been treated at a given dose and
the observed data indicate that the probability of the  current dose's efficacy rate  exceeding the target efficacy rate is less than 30%, then we eliminate this dose from the trial  to avoid
exposing future patients to these futile doses. The probability
threshold can be specified with <code>cutoff.eli.efficacy</code>.  This corresponds to two possible dose assignments: "EUE" and "DUE", both excluding this dose from the trial. "EUE" denotes escalation due to unacceptable low efficacy and "DUE" denotes de-escalation due to unacceptable low efficacy.
</p>
<p>An attractive feature of the Keyboard design is that its dose escalation and
de-escalation rule can be tabulated before implementing the trial. Thus,
when conducting the trial, no real-time calculation or model fitting is needed, and one
needs to count only the number of patients, the number of DLTs, and the number of responses observed at the current dose and the desicion to escalate or de-escalate is  based on the pre-tabulated
decision rules.
