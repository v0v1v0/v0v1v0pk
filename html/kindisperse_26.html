<h2>Create Dispersal Model of an Organism</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function creates an object of class <code>DispersalModel</code> carrying organism-specific information about dispersal stages (with axial
sigmas), FS &amp; HS branch points, and the dispersal stage at which sampling occurs.It is used with the
<code>simulate_kindist_custom</code> function to enable the simulation of uniquely defined breeding &amp; dispersal cycles.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dispersal_model(
  ...,
  .FS = 0,
  .HS = .FS,
  .sampling_stage = 0,
  .cycle = 0,
  .breeding_stage = .HS,
  .visible_stage = .FS
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>name, value (numeric) pairs pairing custom lifestages with their corresponding axial dispersal values. MUST
be in chronological order across the entire breeding cycle.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>.FS</code></td>
<td>
<p>(character) - breeding cycle stage at which first substantial FS-phased dispersal occurs. Must correspond to a
previously described cycle stage name. Typically reflects the first dispersal of female gametes from the mother at (variously)
egg-laying, birth, weaning stages (species-dependent). Use care in adapting to situations where multiple breeding and/or dispersal
routes commonly lead to the FS phase</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>.HS</code></td>
<td>
<p>(character) - breeding cycle stage at which first substantial HS-phased dispersal occurs. Must correspond to a
previously described cycle stage name. Typically reflects the movement of male gametes at e.g. the breeding stage (use care in adapting
to situations where multiple dispersal routes commonly lead to the HS phase)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>.sampling_stage</code></td>
<td>
<p>(character) - stage in the breeding cycle at which samples are to be collected for kin identification. Must correspond
to a previously described cycle stage name. (so collection of eggs corresponds to an egg-laying stage, as juveniles to a juvenile stage, etc.)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>.cycle</code></td>
<td>
<p>(integer &gt;= -1 or vector of two such integers) breeding cycle numbers of dispersed kin to be modeled. Represents
the number of complete breeding cycles each simulated individual has undergone before the sampling point, where the time between
first dispersal and first reproduction is coded as '0', that between first and second reproduction '1', etc. (default 0). If .cycle
is specially set to '-1' this constitutes the sampling of an individual before it has differentiated (via dispersal) from the parent. Only use in spp.
where there is likely to be a reasonable equivalence between breeding stages across a lifespan. As the rest of the model is compatible
with a variety of cycle points, this parameter will often be overridden by the 'cycle' parameter in the <code>simulate_kindist_custom</code> function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>.breeding_stage</code></td>
<td>
<p>(character) - stage in the cycle at which breeding occurs. Must correspond to a previously described cycle
stage name. By default, equated with the .HS stage. This stage corresponds to the <strong>generation</strong> of next-generation individuals;
the .FS &amp; .HS stages correspond to their separation. Needed for situations where individuals are sampled before they separate from the parent.
Modify if the modeled .HS gamete dispersal event does not correspond to the initial breeding event.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>.visible_stage</code></td>
<td>
<p>(character) - stage in the cycle at the <strong>beginning</strong> of which individuals are visible to the study for
sampling rather than their parents (i.e. the beginning point of <code>cycle 0</code>). By default, equated with the .FS stage. This parameter
determines how many dispersal stages individuals have gone through before they are sampled - if <code>.sampling_stage</code> occurs just
<strong>after</strong> <code>.visible_stage</code>, the sampled individuals will have dispersed through only a small amount of the breeding cycle. if
<code>.sampling_stage</code> occurs just <strong>before</strong> <code>.visible_stage</code>, the sampled individuals will have dispersed throughout most
of the breeding cycle before being sampled. If <code>.cycle</code> is set to <code>-1</code>, dispersal stages between breeding &amp; visibility
can be accessed.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The original simulation functions in this package (<code>simulate_kindist_simple()</code> &amp; <code>simulate_kindist_composite</code>) were
designed for an organism with a specific (&amp; relatively simple) breeding &amp; dispersal cycle. 'simple' corresponded to a single
dispersal event across a lifespan, equivalency of all dispersal phases (FS, HS, PO) and no lifetime overlaps. 'composite'
corresponded to many insect dispersal situations, where breeding &amp; oviposition are the key 'phase-defining' events (i.e.,
they lead to the initial gamete dispersal of half siblings &amp; full siblings from each other), where field sampling typically
occurs via ovitraps
</p>
<p>More general dispersal scenarios (e.g in mammals) require the ability to uniquely specify a variety of distinct breeding
ecologies &amp; sampling schemes: the <code>DispersalModel</code> class paired with the <code>simulate_kindist_custom</code>
function achieves this by defining a breeding cycle with an arbitrary number of dispersal phases (the <code>dispersal_vector</code>
slot, accessed by the <code>dispersal_vector</code> method).
</p>
<p>The breeding structure of a species may also impact at which stage
FS and HS phase branches occur. In <em>Ae. aegypti</em>, males mate with multiple females in a (single) breeding season, and a female
typically carried the egg of only one male. In this context the FS (full-sibling) phase would be set to correspond to the female's
oviposition dispersal, while the HS (half-sibling) phase would be set to correspond to the male's breeding dispersal (as its gametes
will then be dispersed by multiple females across their gravid &amp; ovipositional phases). However, in e.g. some species of the marsupial
<em>Antechinus</em>, the FS branch point would be more appropriately associated with juveniles at the time that they leave the mother's
pouch. The <code>.FS</code> and <code>.HS</code> parameters enable the assignment of these phase branches to any
defined life phase. Similarly, the <code>.sampling_stage</code> parameter allow the sampling point to be set to correspond to any
phase of the defined breeding cycle (this is later accessed with the <code>sampling_stage</code> method).
</p>
<p>The final parameter stored in this object is the breeding cycle number <code>.cycle</code>, accessed later by the <code>breeding_cycle</code> method.
This parameter enables the treatment of species that undergo multiple breeding cycles in one lifetime. This is defined as a length two
vector describing the number of breeding cycles undergone by the final descendant of branch 1 and branch 2 of the dispersal pedigree before
their sampling. (where branch one is the 'senior' and branch two the 'junior' member of the pedigree) (so uncle is branch one, nephew branch
two, grandmother branch one, granddaughter branch two, etc.). For each member of the resulting kin pair, the cycle number represents the
number of complete breeding cycles each individual has undergone before the sampling point, where the time between birth and first
reproduction is coded as '0', that between first and second reproduction '1', etc. This enables an application of the simulation
functions defined here to deal with populations with some amount of overlap between generations.
</p>
<p>Note that this 'breeding cycle' approach is only applicable in situations where there is an approximate equivalence between the dispersal which
occurs in the first 'juvenile' breeding cycle and that which occurs between later breeding cycles. This parameter is implemented here, but it
will often be more productive to implement it instead as a parameter of the <code>simulate_kindist_custom</code> function (the cycle parameter
there if set overrides whatever was defined within this object)
