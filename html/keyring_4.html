<h2>Environment variable keyring backend</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a simple keyring backend, that stores/uses secrets in
environment variables of the R session.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It does not support multiple keyrings. It also does not support listing
all keys, since there is no way to distinguish keys from regular
environment variables.
</p>
<p>It does support service names and usernames: they will be separated
with a <code>:</code> character in the name of the environment variable. (Note that
such an environment variable typically cannot be set or queried from a
shell, but it can be set and queried from R or other programming
languages.)
</p>
<p>See backend for the documentation of the class's methods.
