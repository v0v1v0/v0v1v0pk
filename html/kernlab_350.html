<h2>Spam E-mail Database</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set collected at Hewlett-Packard Labs, that classifies 4601
e-mails as spam or non-spam. In addition to this class label there are 57
variables indicating the frequency of certain words and characters in the
e-mail.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(spam)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 4601 observations and 58 variables.
</p>
<p>The first 48 variables contain the frequency of the variable name
(e.g., business) in the e-mail. If the variable name starts with num (e.g.,
num650) the it indicates the frequency of the corresponding number (e.g., 650).
The variables 49-54 indicate the frequency of the characters ‘;’, ‘(’, ‘[’, ‘!’,
‘$’, and ‘#’. The variables 55-57 contain the average, longest 
and total run-length of capital letters. Variable 58 indicates the type of the
mail and is either <code>"nonspam"</code> or <code>"spam"</code>, i.e. unsolicited
commercial e-mail.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data set contains 2788 e-mails classified as <code>"nonspam"</code> and 1813
classified as <code>"spam"</code>.
</p>
<p>The “spam” concept is diverse: advertisements for products/web
sites, make money fast schemes, chain letters, pornography...
This collection of spam e-mails came from the collectors' postmaster and
individuals who had filed spam.  The collection of non-spam
e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence
the word 'george' and the area code '650' are indicators of
non-spam.  These are useful when constructing a personalized
spam filter.  One would either have to blind such non-spam
indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to
generate a general purpose spam filter.
