<h2>KHQ: Methods for Calculating 'KHQ' Scores and 'KHQ5D' Utility Index Scores</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) is a disease-specific, 
self-administered questionnaire designed specific to assess the impact of 
Urinary Incontinence (UI) on Quality of Life. The questionnaire was developed 
by Kelleher and collaborators (1997) &lt;doi:10.1111/j.1471-0528.1997.tb11006.x&gt;. 
It is a simple, acceptable and reliable measure to use in the clinical setting 
and a research tool that is useful in evaluating UI treatment outcomes. 
The KHQ five dimensions (KHQ5D) is a condition-specific preference-based 
measure developed by Brazier and collaborators (2008) &lt;doi:10.1177/0272989X07301820&gt;. 
Although not as popular as the SF6D &lt;doi:10.1016/S0895-4356(98)00103-6&gt; and 
EQ-5D &lt;https://euroqol.org/&gt;, the KHQ5D measures health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL) specifically for UI, not general conditions like the others 
two instruments mentioned. The KHQ5D ca be used in the clinical and economic 
evaluation of health care. The subject self-rates their health in terms of 
five dimensions: Role Limitation (RL), Physical Limitations (PL), Social 
Limitations (SL), Emotions (E), and Sleep (S). Frequently the states on these 
five dimensions are converted to a single utility index using country specific 
value sets, which can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of 
health care as well as in population health surveys. This package provides 
methods to calculate scores for each dimension of the KHQ; converts KHQ item 
scores to KHQ5D scores; and also calculates the utility index of the KHQ5D.
