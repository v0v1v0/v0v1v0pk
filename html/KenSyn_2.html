<h2>Meta-analysis dataset: estimation the effectiveness of a fungicidal treatment to control Phyllosticta citricarpa, a citrus fungus.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data set consists of the data collected from litterature for a meta-analysis.
It contains the results of 16 trials conducted in different orchards located in different
regions around the world. Each trial has two treatments: an untreated part (the control, X = Fung_Gp = 0)
and a part treated with a fungicide (X = Fung_Gp = 1). In each treatment, 300 to 2000 fruits were observed, and the number of diseased fruits was counted.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>a <code>RangedData</code> instance, 1 row per measurement. NbFruits : number of fruits observed, NbDiseasedF : number of diseased fruits, Code : code of the experiment, Fung_Gp : treatment (1: fungicid, 0: control)</p>
