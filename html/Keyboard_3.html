<h2>Dose Escalation or De-escalation Boundaries for Drug-combination Trials</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates the optimal dose escalation or de-escalation boundaries when
conducting a drug-combination trial with the Keyboard design.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get.boundary.comb.kb(
  target,
  ncohort,
  cohortsize,
  n.earlystop = 100,
  marginL = 0.05,
  marginR = 0.05,
  cutoff.eli = 0.95,
  offset = 0.05,
  extrasafe = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>target</code></td>
<td>
<p>The target dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ncohort</code></td>
<td>
<p>A scalar specifying the total number of cohorts in the trial.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cohortsize</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of patients in the cohort.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n.earlystop</code></td>
<td>
<p>The early stopping parameter. If the number of patients treated at
the current dose reaches <code>n.earlystop</code>, then stop the trial
and select the MTD based on the observed data. The default
value is 100.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>marginL</code></td>
<td>
<p>The difference between the target and the lower bound of the
"target key" (proper dosing interval) to be defined.<br>
The default is 0.05.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>marginR</code></td>
<td>
<p>The difference between the target and the upper bound of the
"target key" (proper dosing interval) to be defined.<br>
The default is 0.05.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cutoff.eli</code></td>
<td>
<p>The cutoff to eliminate an overly toxic dose and all
higher doses for safety.<br>
The recommended value is 0.95.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>offset</code></td>
<td>
<p>A small positive number (between 0 and 0.5) to control how strict
the stopping rule is when <code>extrasafe=TRUE</code>. A larger value leads
to a stricter stopping rule. The default value is 0.05.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>extrasafe</code></td>
<td>
<p>Set <code>extrasafe=TRUE</code> to impose a stricter stopping rule for extra safety, expressed as the stopping boundary value in the result.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Keyboard design relies on the posterior distribution of the toxicity
probability to guide dosage. To determine whether to escalate or de-escalate the dose, given the observed data at the current dose, we first identify an
interval that has the highest posterior probability, referred to as
the "strongest key". This key represents where the true dose-limiting
toxicity (DLT) rate of the current dose is most likely located. If the
strongest key is to the left of the "target key", then we escalate
the dose because the data suggest that the current
dose is likely to underdose patients; if the strongest key is
to the right of the target key, then we de-escalate the dose
because the observed data suggest that the current dose is likely to overdose the patients; and
if the strongest key is the target key, then we retain the current dose because
the observed data support that the current dose is most likely to be in the
proper dosing interval.
Graphically, the strongest key is the one with the largest area under the
posterior distribution curve of the DLT rate of the current dose.
</p>
<p><img src="../help/figures/Keyboard.jpg" alt="Keyboard.jpg"></p>
<p>An attractive feature of the Keyboard design is that its dose escalation and
de-escalation rules can be tabulated before the onset of the trial. Thus,
when conducting the trial, no calculation or model fitting is needed, and we
need to count only the number of DLTs observed at the current dose;
the decision to escalate or de-escalate the dose is based on the pre-tabulated
decision rules.
</p>
<p>Given all observed data, we use matrix isotonic regression to obtain an
estimate of the toxicity rate of the combination of dose level j of drug A
and dose level k of drug B and  to  select as the MTD  the combination with the
toxicity estimate that is closest to the target. When there are ties, we
randomly choose one as the MTD.
</p>
<p>For patient safety, we apply the following Bayesian overdose control rule
after each cohort:
if at least 3 patients have been treated at the given dose and
the observed data indicate that the probability of the current combination dose's toxicity rate being above the target toxicity rate is more
than 95%,  then we exclude this dose and beyond to avoid
exposing future patients to these overly toxic doses. The probability
threshold can be specified with <code>cutoff.eli</code>. If the lowest dose
combination (1, 1) is overly toxic, then the trial terminates early, and no dose
is selected as the MTD.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a matrix, including the dose escalation, de-escalation, and elimination boundaries.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>In most clinical applications, the target DLT rate is often a rough
guess, but finding a dose level with a DLT rate reasonably close to the
target rate (which ideally would be the MTD) is what interests the
investigator.
