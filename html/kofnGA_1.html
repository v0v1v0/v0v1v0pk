<h2>kofnGA: A genetic algorithm for selection of fixed-size subsets.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A genetic algorithm (GA) to do subset selection:  search for a subset of a fixed size,
k, from the integers 1:n, such that user-supplied function is minimized at that subset.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package provides the function <code>kofnGA</code>, which implements a GA to perform
subset selection; that is, choosing the best <em>k</em> elements from among <em>n</em>
possibilities. We label the set of possibilities from which we are choosing by the integers
<code>1:n</code>, and a solution is represented by an index vector, i.e., a vector of integers in
the range [1, n] (with no duplicates) indicating which members of the set to choose. The
objective function (defining which solution is “best”) is arbitrary and user-supplied;
the only restriction on this function is that its first argument must be an index vector
encoding the solution.
</p>
<p>The search results output by <code>kofnGA</code> are a list object assigned to the S3 class
<code>GAsearch</code>. The package includes <code>summary</code>, <code>print</code>, and <code>plot</code> methods
for this class to make it easier to inspect the results.
