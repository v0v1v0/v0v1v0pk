<h2>
Supervised and Unsupervised Self-Organising Maps
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions to train self-organising maps (SOMs). Also interrogation of the maps and prediction using trained maps are supported. The name of the package refers to Teuvo Kohonen, the inventor of the SOM.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The kohonen package implements several forms of self-organising maps
(SOMs). Online and batch training algorithms are available; batch
training can also be done in parallel. Multiple data layers may be
presented to the training algorithm, with potentially different distance
measures for each layer. The overall distance is a weighted average of
the layer distances. Layers may be selected through the <code>whatmap</code>
argument, or by providing a weight of zero. The basic function is
<code>supersom</code>; <code>som</code> is simply a wrapper for SOMs using just one
layer (the classical form).
</p>
<p>New data may be mapped to a trained SOM using the <code>map.kohonen</code>
function. Function <code>predict.kohonen</code> will map data to the SOM, and
will return predictions (i.e., average values for winning units) for
those layers that are not in the new data object.
</p>
<p>Several visualisation methods are available in function
<code>plot.kohonen</code>.
