<h2>Predicts values of the time series using k-nearest neighbors algorithm.
Values corresponding to instants from initial + 1 to the last one are
predicted. The first value predicted, which corresponds to instant
initial + 1, is calculated using instants from 1 to instant initial;
the second value predicted, which corresponds to instant initial + 2, is
predicted using instants from 1 to instant initial + 1; and so on until the
last value, which corresponds to instant n (length of the time series),
is predicted using instants from 1 to instant n - 1.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Predicts values of the time series using k-nearest neighbors algorithm.
Values corresponding to instants from initial + 1 to the last one are
predicted. The first value predicted, which corresponds to instant
initial + 1, is calculated using instants from 1 to instant initial;
the second value predicted, which corresponds to instant initial + 2, is
predicted using instants from 1 to instant initial + 1; and so on until the
last value, which corresponds to instant n (length of the time series),
is predicted using instants from 1 to instant n - 1.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">knn_past(
  y,
  k,
  d,
  initial = NULL,
  distance = "euclidean",
  weight = "proportional",
  v = 1,
  threads = 1
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>A time series or a trained kNN model generated by the
knn_param_search_function. In case that a model is provided the rest of
parameters will be ignored and all of them will be taken from the model.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of neighbors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>d</code></td>
<td>
<p>Length of each of the 'elements'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>initial</code></td>
<td>
<p>Variable that determines the limit of the known past for the
first instant predicted.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>distance</code></td>
<td>
<p>Type of metric to evaluate the distance between points. Many
metrics are supported: euclidean, manhattan, dynamic time warping, camberra
and others. For more information about supported metrics check the values
that 'method' argument of function parDist (from parallelDist package)
can take as this is the function used to calculate the distances. Link to
the package info: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/parallelDist
Some of the values that this argument can take are "euclidean", "manhattan",
"dtw", "camberra", "chord".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weight</code></td>
<td>
<p>Type of weight to be used at the time of calculating the
predicted value with a weighted mean. Three supported: proportional,
average, linear.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>proportional</dt>
<dd>
<p>the weight assigned to each neighbor is inversely
proportional to its distance</p>
</dd>
<dt>average</dt>
<dd>
<p>all neighbors are assigned with the same weight</p>
</dd>
<dt>linear</dt>
<dd>
<p>nearest neighbor is assigned with weight k, second closest
neighbor with weight k-1, and so on until the least nearest neighbor
which is assigned with a weight of 1.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>v</code></td>
<td>
<p>Variable to be predicted if given multivariate time series.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threads</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of threads to be used when parallelizing, default is 1</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>
