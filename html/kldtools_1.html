<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function computes three estimators of Kullback-Leibler Divergence
(KLD): KLD, symmetrized KLD and Turing's perspective KLD, based on Zhang
(2017). It compares two empirical, discrete distributions with the
confidence interval estimate. The limiting distribution in this method is
normal. Simply speaking, these estimators measure the difference between
two probability distributions.
</p>
<p>More specifically, the function calculates the confidence intervals for
these KLD estimators with the measure of standard deviation (sd), for
which the equation is different from that of the most known theories in
the field (for more detail, see Zhang 2017, Section 5.3):
</p>
<p>sd^2 = g(t(v))*sum(v)*g(v)
</p>
<p>However, our function uses a corrected formula of the vector g(v) in  the
above-given formula, the inconsistency in which has been identified by
comparing the results obtained from the application of this formula  and
its simplified version for k = 2 (Zhang 2017: 187).
</p>
<p>A deeper enquiry into this problem has led to detecting the formatting
error in formula (5.94) of the book (Zhang 2017: 185): it is missing the
elements for the p distribution. We would like to thank Dr. Jialin Zhang for
verifying the correct formula of the vector in the calculation of the
variance  of the KLD plug-in estimator.
</p>
<p>Also, note that if there are only two elements in probability
distributions, an infinite bias emerges (Zhang &amp; Grabchak 2014), which
makes the  estimation less reliable.
</p>
<p>The measure of symmetrized KLD (S) is calculated with the following
formula:
</p>
<p>S = S(p, q) = 1/2*(KLD(p||q) + KLD(q||p)
</p>
<p>Although similar to Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), this measure is
different in that it is not a smoothed version of divergence.
</p>
<p>Please note that the discussed estimators (which are based on empirical
data) allow for a negative value of KLD (i.e. in the values of the CIs
and Turing's perspective estimator), despite the proven fact that
theoretical KLD should always take a non-negative value. Even though
precluded by Zhang's (2017: 152, Theorem 5.1) theory, it is possible to
apply these tests, since, in fact, they compare the absolute values of
fluctuation of the properly normalized empirical counterparts of KLD
around a theoretical value of KLD with the quantile of normal 
distribution.
</p>
<p>The application areas for these three estimators might be different. By
way of suggestion, the KLD estimator is appropriate for a study of
differences between distributions in systems (samples), whose design
criteria differ. On the other hand, symmetrized KLD may be more suitable
for the systems (samples) with a more similar design.
</p>
<p>In addition, the differences between KLD and symmetrized KLD can inform
researchers on a degree of symmetry between the systems (samples): the
larger the  difference between these measures, the greater the asymmetry
between their distributions.
</p>
<p>Finally, Turing's perspective estimator is believed to yield more precise
results and is appropriate for the data containing zeros (i.e. only in
the q distribution), which are handled with the augmentation added to the
formula of standard deviation (i.e. to the vector g(v) in the
above-mentioned formula of sd).

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The list with the following components: "KLD" stands for the measure of
KLD; "KLD.s" for the measure of symmetrized KLD; "Turing" for the measure
of Turing's perspective KLD - and "*sd" for their respective standard
deviations; and "*ci.left" for the lower and "*ci.right" for the upper
limits of their respective confidence intervals - "*CI".
