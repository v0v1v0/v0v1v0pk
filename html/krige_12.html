<h2>Congressional District Public Opinion Ideology in 2010</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data present measures of ideology in 2010 for 434 districts for the U.S. 
House of Representatives, recorded as the variable <code>krige.cong</code>. Forecasts 
are based on a kriging model fitted over the 2008 Cooperative Congressional 
Election Survey (CCES), paired with predictive data from the 2010 Census. Each 
district's public ideology is paired with the DW-NOMINATE common space score 
of each of its representative in 2011 (update from McCarty, Poole and Rosenthal 
1997). Eight districts have repeated observations in order to include the DW-NOMINATE 
score when a member was replaced mid-term.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The <code>congCombined</code> dataset has 442 observations and 12 variables. 4
34 out of 435 congressional districts are covered, with eight districts duplicated 
when a member was replaced mid-term.
