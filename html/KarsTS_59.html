determinismKTS: estimate determinism
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is used to study the determinism of a system, based on the number and length of the diagonal lines that contains the recurrence matrix that represents the system. It is used through the button Determinism in the Anaylisis menu.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The following outputs are written on KarsTS output window: recurrence rate, determinism, ratio and summary of the lengths of the diagonal lines. Besides, a new window containing a histogram of diagonal lines pops up.
