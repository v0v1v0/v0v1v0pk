<h2>Searches for the optimal values of k and d for a given time series. First,
values corresponding to instants from initial + 1 to the last one are
predicted. The first value predicted, which corresponds to instant
initial + 1, is calculated using instants from 1 to instant initial; the
second value predicted, which corresponds to instant initial + 2, is
predicted using instants from 1 to instant initial + 1; and so on until last
value, which corresponds to instant n (length of the given time series), is
predicted using instants from 1 to instant n - 1. Finally, the error is
evaluated between the predicted values and the real values of the series.
This version of the optimization function uses a parallelized distances
calculation function, and the computation of the predicted values is done
parallelizing by the number of d's.</h2>

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>distance</code></td>
<td>
<p>Type of metric to evaluate the distance between points. Many
metrics are supported: euclidean, manhattan, dynamic time warping, camberra
and others. For more information about supported metrics check the values
that 'method' argument of function parDist (from parallelDist package) can
take as this is the function used to calculate the distances. Link to the
package info: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/parallelDist
Some of the values that this argument can take are "euclidean",
"manhattan", "dtw", "camberra", "chord".</p>
