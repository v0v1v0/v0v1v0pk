<h2>knockoff: A package for controlled variable selection</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package implements the Knockoff Filter, which is a powerful and versatile tool for 
controlled variable selection.
</p>


<h3>Outline</h3>

<p>The procedure is based on the contruction of artificial 'knockoff copies' of the variables 
present in the given statistical model. Then, it selects those variables that are clearly better 
than their corresponding knockoffs, based on some measure of variable importance.
A wide range of statistics and machine learning tools can be exploited to estimate the 
importance of each variable, while guaranteeing finite-sample control of the false
discovery rate (FDR).
</p>
<p>The Knockoff Filter controls the FDR in either of two statistical scenarios:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The "model-X" scenario: the response <code class="reqn">Y</code> can depend on the variables <code class="reqn">X=(X_1,\ldots,X_p)</code>
in an arbitrary and unknown fashion, but the distribution of <code class="reqn">X</code> must be known. In thise case
there are no constraints on the dimensions <code class="reqn">n</code> and <code class="reqn">p</code> of the problem.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "fixed-X" scenario: the response <code class="reqn">Y</code> depends upon <code class="reqn">X</code> through a 
homoscedastic Gaussian linear model and the problem is low-dimensional (<code class="reqn">n \geq p</code>). 
In this case, no modeling assumptions on <code class="reqn">X</code> are required. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
