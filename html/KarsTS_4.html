<h2>
anaSamper: analyzing sampling periods and gaps
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Time series need to have a homogeneous sampling period for most calculations.This function divides a time series in homogeneous-sampling-period pieces that contain either observations or NAs.This information allows to decide how to resample the time series. Note that it also provides a list of gaps. 
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Once chosen the time serie to analyze, KarsTS offers a list of possible sampling periods (time jumps in the time series), but a human decision is necessary to separate safely true sampling periods from gaps.Tipically, time jumps correspoding to sampling periods appear many times. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A table containing the aforementioned information appears on KarsTS output window.
