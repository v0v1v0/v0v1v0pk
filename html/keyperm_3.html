<h2>Create an Indexed Frequency List</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The keyperm package stores frequency lists in a special data structure called
indexed frequency list. This can currently be created from a tdm object as   
implemented in the tm package.
</p>
<p>Indexed frequency lists are essentially frequency lists stored in a three-column format,
similar to the simple triplet matrix internally used by tm to store term-document-matrices.
The first column stores number of document <code>i</code>, second number of term <code>j</code> and the third the 
frequencies with which the term <code>j</code> occurs in document <code>i</code>. Zero occurences are omitted. 
All columns contain integers, and the frequency list is sorted by document.  
</p>
<p>The object returned is of class <code>indexed_frequency_list</code>. In addition to the actual frequency 
list it contains an index for fast access as well as pre-computed total number of tokens per
document and total occurences per term.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">create_ifl(
  tdm,
  subset_terms = 1:dim(tdm)[1],
  subset_docs = 1:dim(tdm)[2],
  corpus
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tdm</code></td>
<td>
<p>a tdm-matrix from the tm package. Currently, this is the only supported input, but others may be added in later versions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subset_terms</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of terms to be considered. Can be integer (indices) or boolean. Terms not included still are counted for total number of token per document.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subset_docs</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of documents to be considered. Can be integer (indices) or boolean. Documents excluded do not contribute to total number of occurences of a term.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>corpus</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector indicating which documents belong to corpus A (first corpus). Can be integer (indices) or boolean. Currently, only comparisons of two corpora are supported.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with class <code>indexed_frequency_list</code> containing the following components:
