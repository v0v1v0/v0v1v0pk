<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rpatterns</code></td>
<td>
<p>A binary data frame or matrix where each row specifies
the response pattern of one individual to the set of domain problems in <code>x</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>kassess</code> assigns individuals to their corresponding knowledge state
in a knowledge structure.
</p>
<p>Assessing individuals based on a <code>"deterministic"</code> procedure
starts by determining a domain problem <em>a</em>, which is contained in
approximately half of the available knowledge states. If the individual
being assessed has successfully solved the respective domain problem <em>a</em>,
all knowledge states that do not contain domain problem <em>a</em> are
removed from the set of potential knowledge states of the individual. If,
on the other hand, the individual has not solved the respective domain
problem <em>a</em>, all knowledge states that do contain domain problem <em>a</em>
are removed from the set of potential knowledge states of the individual.
From the remaining knowledge states a domain problem <em>b</em>, which again
is contained in approximately half of the still available knowledge states,
is selected. If the individual has successfully solved the respective
domain problem <em>b</em>, all knowledge states that do not contain domain
problem <em>b</em> are removed from the set of potential knowledge states
of the individual. If, on the other hand, the individual has solved the
respective domain problem <em>b</em>, all knowledge states that do contain
domain problem <em>b</em> are removed from the set of potential knowledge
states of the individual. This procedure is repeated until only one
knowledge state is left. This is the knowledge state the individual is
currently located in.
