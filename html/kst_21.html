<h2>Knowledge Structure</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a knowledge structure from a surmise relation or knowledge states. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  kstructure(x)
  kfamset(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either an endorelation (see <code>relation</code>)
representing a surmise relation, or a <code>set</code> of sets 
each representing one knowledge state.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The most basic assumption of knowledge space theory is that every
knowledge domain can be represented in terms of a set of domain problems
<em>Q</em>. Moreover, knowledge space theory assumes dependencies between
these domain problems in that knowledge of a given domain problem or a
subset of problems may be a prerequisite for knowledge of another, more
difficult or complex domain problem. These prerequisite relations are
realized by <em>surmise relations</em>, which create a quasi-order between
different domain problems. One advantage of these surmise relations is
that they reduce the quantity of all possible solution patterns to a more
manageable amount of <em>knowledge states</em>. Each of these knowledge
states represents the subset of domain problems an individual is capable
of solving. The collection of all knowledge states captures the
organization of the domain and is referred to as <em>knowledge
structure</em>.
</p>
<p><code>kstructure</code> takes an endorelation representing a surmise relation
or a set of sets each representing one knowledge state (e.g., one clause
of a surmise system) and returns the corresponding knowledge structure.
A knowledge structure always contains the empty set and <em>Q</em>.
</p>
<p><code>kfamset</code> does essentially the same but without ensuring that the
empty set and <em>Q</em> are included.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> object of class <code>kstructure</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Note that by default the quotes indicate the fact that the items 
are represented by characters. For displaying purposes, these 
quotes may be turned off by setting respective set options (see 
<code>options</code>).
