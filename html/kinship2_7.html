<h2>
Error check for a family classification
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a family id vector, also compute the familial grouping from
first principles using the parenting data, and compare the results.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">familycheck(famid, id, father.id, mother.id, newfam)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>famid</code></td>
<td>

<p>a vector of family identifiers
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>id</code></td>
<td>

<p>a vector of unique subject identifiers
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>father.id </code></td>
<td>

<p>vector containing the id of the biological father
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mother.id </code></td>
<td>

<p>vector containing the id of the biological mother
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>newfam</code></td>
<td>

<p>the result of a call to <code>makefamid</code>.
If this has allready been computed by the user,
adding it as an argument shortens the running time somewhat.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>makefamid</code> function is used to create a
de novo family id from the parentage data, and this is compared to the
family id given in the data.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a data frame with one row for each unique family id in the
<code>famid</code> argument.
Components of the output are
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>famid</code></td>
<td>

<p>the family id, as entered into the data set
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>

<p>number of subjects in the family
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>unrelated</code></td>
<td>

<p>number of them that appear to be unrelated to anyone else 
in the entire pedigree set.  
This is usually marry-ins with no 
children (in the pedigree), and if so are not a problem.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>split</code></td>
<td>

<p>number of unique "new" family ids.
If this is 0, it means that no one in this "family" is related to
anyone else (not good); 
1 = everythings is fine;
2+= the family appears to be a set of disjoint trees.  Are you
missing some of the people?
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>join</code></td>
<td>

<p>number of other families that had a unique famid, but are actually
joined to this one.  0 is the hope.
If there are any joins, then an attribute "join" is attached.  It will be
a matrix with famid as row labels, new-family-id as the columns, and
the number of subjects as entries.

<pre><code class="language-R"># use 2 sample peds
