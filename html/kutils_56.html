<h2>Reverse the levels in a factor</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simple literal reversal. Will stop with an error message if x is
not a factor (or ordered) variable.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">reverse(x, eol = c("Skip", "DNP"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a factor variable</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>eol</code></td>
<td>
<p>values to be kept at the end of the list. Does not
accept regular expresssions, just literal text strings
representing values.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Sometimes people want to
reverse some levels, excluding others and leaving them at the end
of the list. The "eol" argument sets aside some levels and puts
them at the end of the list of levels.
</p>
<p>The use case for the <code>eol</code> argument is a factor
with several missing value labels, as appears in SPSS. With
up to 18 different missing codes, we want to leave them
at the end. In the case for which this was designed, the
researcher did not want to designate those values as
missing before inspecting the pattern of observed values.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a new factor variable with reversed values

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Consider alphabetication of upper and lower
x &lt;- factor(c("a", "b", "c", "C", "a", "c"))
levels(x)
xr1 &lt;- reverse(x)
xr1
## Keep "C" at end of list, after reverse others
xr2 &lt;- reverse(x, eol = "C")
xr2
y &lt;- ordered(x, levels = c("a", "b", "c", "C"))
yr1 &lt;- reverse(y)
class(yr1)[1] == "ordered"
yr1
## Hmm. end of list amounts to being "maximal".
## Unintended side-effect, but interesting.
yr2 &lt;- reverse(y, eol = "C")
yr2
## What about a period as a value (SAS missing)
z &lt;- factor(c("a", "b", "c", "b", "c", "."))
reverse(z)
z &lt;- factor(c(".", "a", "b", "c", "b", "c", "."))
reverse(z)
## How about R NA's
z &lt;- factor(c(".", "a", NA, "b", "c", "b", NA, "c", "."))
z
reverse(z)
z &lt;- ordered(c(".", "a", NA, "b", "c", "b", NA, "c", "."))
z
str(z)
## Put "." at end of list
zr &lt;- reverse(z, eol = ".")
zr
str(zr)
z &lt;- ordered(c(".", "c", NA, "e", "a", "c", NA, "e", "."),
         levels = c(".", "c", "e", "a"))
reverse(z, eol = ".")
reverse(z, eol = c("a", "."))
