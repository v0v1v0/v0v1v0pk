<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function enables the testing of the impact of some basic sampling constraints that might be encountered in study design or
implementation on the effectiveness of the <code>kindisperse</code> estimation of intergenerational dispersal. It is typically paired with
a simulation function such as <code>simulate_kindist_composite</code> to generate a 'pure' dataset, then an estimation function
such as <code>axpermute</code> to examine the impact of filter settings on the 'detected' value of dispersal sigma. The filter
parameters <code>upper</code>, <code>lower</code>, &amp; <code>spacing</code> all work on the vector of (direction-independent) distances, &amp; the parameter
<code>n</code> enables the random subsampling of n kin dyads. The parameter <code>dims</code> requires 2D location information for each individual,
meaning it can ordinarily only be used with the <code>KinPairSimulation</code> object (not <code>KinPairData</code>). All filter parameters are
stackable.
</p>
<p>The <code>upper</code> parameter implements a cutoff for the <strong>maximum</strong> distance allowable in the dataset. If set to e.g. 100m, all kin dyads
separated by a distance greater than 100m will be excluded from the filtered dataset. Note that this is a geometry-independent metric;
it is naive to the edge effects of an actual sample site. The <code>lower</code> parameter implements a cutoff for the <strong>minimum</strong>
distance allowable in the dataset.It operates in the same manner as the previous parameter (in this case, removing results smaller
than a distance threshold)
</p>
<p>The <code>spacing</code> parameter as currently implemented takes all distances &amp; alters them to lie at the midpoint of a bin with width set
by this parameter. So if <code>spacing</code> is set to 10 meters, all kin pairs with distances between 0 and 10m will have their distances
rest to 5m, all between 10 &amp; 20 will be set to 15 m, etc. (quantizing the data). Note that once again this is a geometry-independent
action: These binwiths &amp; 'trap spacing' are not spatially related to each other like they would be in a sample site, and there is no
simulated dropout of kinpairs too far from a trap. There is also no geometry-dependent profiling of possible frequency of recaptures
across each distance category (will be implemented in a future version). (this parameter leaves 2D spatial information intact)
</p>
<p>The <code>dims</code> parameter defines the dimensions of a rectangle within which <strong>both</strong> individuals of a kin dyad will need to lie
to be included in the filtered dataset. This measure (which excludes e.g. long-distance dispersal into &amp; out of the study site) is
<em>geometry-dependent</em>, unlike the <code>upper</code> parameter. This enables the testing of (rectangular) site geometries potentially
corresponding to an actual site (two-dimensional estimates of dispersal such as <code>kindisperse</code> become unreliable as edge effects
significantly reduce the size of either one or both dimensions with respect to the real underlying dispersal sigma). These site
geometries can be entered in a few ways: (a) a single numeric value, which will be interpreted as the length of the side of a square;
(b) a numeric vector of length two, which will be interpreted as the length &amp; width of the sample site; (c) either of the above passed
to the <code>elongate</code> function, which takes the rectangular site dimensions and alters their <code>aspect ratio</code> (ratio of
length to width) while preserving the underlying area the study site covers. The implementation of this filtering step permutes the
absolute positions of all dyads so that at least one member of the dyad is in the inial site rectangle, while preserving their relative
positions (and angles) with respect to each other. This means that following this step, the xy coordinate positions of each
individual will not match those contained in the previous round. It also means that the repeated calling of this function will
result in a steady reduction in retained kin dyads due to edge effects.
</p>
<p>The <code>n</code> parameter randomly samples n pairs from the dataset. It is implemented after all other filtering has taken place, so
will only sample surviving individuals A typical strategy for the use of this functions in simulations would be to simulate an
extremely large (e.g. one million pairs) dataset, then pass it repeatedly to this filter function, with a final sub-sampling step of
1,000 included. This enables comparisons across sampling conditions (in most cases) regardless of the amount of data filtered prior to
this step.
</p>
<p>As this function returns a <code>KinPairData</code> or <code>KinPairSimulation</code> object, the returned object can be passed back for filtering
an arbitrary number of times, or alternatively passed to an estimation strategy.
</p>
<p>This function can be used to test for bias in the results of a close-kin dispersal study that has been conducted. After the field
sampling, kin identification, &amp; sigma calculation steps, use the estimated sigmas as inputs into simulation functions that are
then filtered for size &amp; geometry of the actual study site (via the <code>dims</code> method). Then pass this filtered dataset back to the
sigma-determining functions. If filtering has resulted in a substantial drop in sigma, the estimate of sigma from the study site has
likely been biased by the site geometry (note that the impact of this is dependent on the shape of the dispersal kernel - the more
leptokurtic (dominated by long-distance dispersal), the more severe bias will be for a particular sigma and site geometry.
