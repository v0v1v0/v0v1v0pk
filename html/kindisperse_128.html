<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is one of a family of functions that implement the core intergenerational dispersal simulations
contained in the <code>kindisperse</code> package. Each of these functions proceeds by the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> identify the pedigree
relationship, dispersal phase (FS, HS &amp; PO) and sampling stage that must be generated;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> randomly assign a coordinate position
to the 'root' individual within the pedigree (i.e. last common ancestor of the dyad, inclusive);
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 'disperse' both pathways from
this root position via the appropriately defined phase dispersal (additively via random draws from the underlying statistical
model, defined by an axial standard deviation - sigma);
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> further disperse both phased descendant branches according to the
number of realised breeding dispersal cycles contained in the defining pedigree (additively via random draws from the chosen
underlying statistical model);
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> add displacement caused by dispersal before the sampling point in a similar manner to above,
defining the final positions of the sampled dispersed kin dyads;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> calculating geographical distances between the
resulting dyads.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These simulation functions operate under an additive variance framework: all individual dispersal events are modeled as random
draws from a bivariate probability distribution defined by an axial standard deviation <code>sigma</code> and (sometimes) a shape
parameter. At present, three such distributions are included as options accessible with the <code>method</code> parameter: the
bivariate normal distribution '<code>Gaussian</code>', the bivariate Laplace distribution '<code>Laplace</code>', and the bivariate
variance-gamma distribution '<code>vgamma</code>'. The <code>Gaussian</code> (normal) distribution enables easy compatibility with the
framework under which much population genetic &amp; dispersal theory (isolation by distance, neighbourhoods, etc.) have been
developed. The <code>Laplace</code> distribution is a multivariate adaptation of the (positive) exponential distribution, and
represents a more 'fat-tailed' (leptokurtic) disperal situation than Gaussian. The <code>vgamma</code> distribution is a mixture
distribution formed by mixing the gamma distribution with the bivariate normal distribution. The flexibility of this
distribution's <code>shape</code> parameter enables us to model arbitrarily leptokurtic dispesal kernels, providing a helpful way
to examine the impacts of (e.g.) long distance dispersal on the overall disperal distribution and sampling decisions. A
<code>vgamma</code> distribution with shape parameter equal to 1 reduces to the bivariate Laplace distribution. As shape approaches
infinity, the <code>vgamma</code> distribution approaches the bivariate normal distribution. As shape approaches zero, the distribution
becomes increasingly leptokurtic.
</p>
<p>The <code>simulate_kindist_simple()</code> function is the most basic of the simulation functions, ignoring all information about
dispersal phase and treating dispersal with a single sigma corresponding to the entire lifecycle to breeding of the
dispersed individuals. It is useful for exploring simple intergenerational dispersal in a stripped back context; for many
typical contexts involving complex dispersal across different phases of the breeding cycle, the other dispersal simulation
functions would be more suitable.
</p>
<p>Following simulation, the results are returned as an object of the specially defined package class <code>KinPairSimulation</code>,
which stores the simulation results along with information about all simulation parameters, and can be further passed to
sample filtering &amp; dispersal estimation functions.
