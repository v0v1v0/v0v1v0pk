<h2>Base Tuner</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Tuner base class.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">BaseTuner(
  oracle,
  hypermodel,
  directory = NULL,
  project_name = NULL,
  overwrite = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>oracle</code></td>
<td>
<p>Instance of Oracle class.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hypermodel</code></td>
<td>
<p>Instance of 'HyperModel' class (or callable that takes hyperparameters and returns a 'Model' instance). It is optional when 'Tuner.run_trial()' is overriden and does not use 'self.hypermodel'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>directory</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string, the relative path to the working directory.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>project_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string, the name to use as prefix for files saved by this Tuner.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overwrite</code></td>
<td>
<p>Boolean, defaults to 'FALSE'. If 'FALSE', reloads an existing project of the same name if one is found. Otherwise, overwrites the project. **kwargs: Arguments for backward compatibility.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>'BaseTuner' is the super class of all 'Tuner' classes. It defines the APIs
for the 'Tuner' classes and serves as a wrapper class for the internal
logics. 'BaseTuner' supports parallel tuning. In parallel tuning, the communication
between 'BaseTuner' and 'Oracle' are all going through gRPC. There are
multiple running instances of 'BaseTuner' but only one 'Oracle'. This design
allows the user to run the same script on multiple machines to launch the
parallel tuning. The 'Oracle' instance should manage the life cycles of all the 'Trial's,
while a 'BaseTuner' is a worker for running the 'Trial's. 'BaseTuner's
requests 'Trial's from the 'Oracle', run them, and report the results back
to the 'Oracle'. A 'BaseTuner' also handles events happening during running
the 'Trial', like saving the model, logging, error handling. Other than
these responsibilities, a 'BaseTuner' should avoid managing a 'Trial' since
the relevant contexts for a 'Trial' are in the 'Oracle', which only
accessible from gRPC. The 'BaseTuner' should be a general tuner for all types of models and avoid
any logic directly related to Keras. The Keras related logics should be
handled by the 'Tuner' class, which is a subclass of 'BaseTuner'.
