<h2>Convert leading or trailing white space and tab characters to nothing.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This eliminates any characters matched by the regular expression
'\s' if they appear at the beginning of a string or at its
end. It does not alter spaces in the interior of a string. This
was created when I was not aware of R's <code>trimws</code> and the purpose
is the same. On our TODO list, we intend to eliminate this function
and replace its use with <code>trimws</code>
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">zapspace(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If x is a character vector, return is a character vector
with leading and trailing white space values removed. If x is
not a character vector, an unaltered x is returned.
