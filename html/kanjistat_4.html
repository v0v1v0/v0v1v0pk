<h2>Compare distances of nearest kanji</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>List distances to nearest neighbors of a given kanji in terms of a reference distance
(which is currently only the stroke edit distance) and compare with values in terms of
another distance (currently only the component transport distance, a.k.a. kanji distance).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">compare_neighborhoods(
  kan,
  refdist = "strokedit",
  refnn = 10,
  compdist = "kanjidist",
  compnn = 0,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>kan</code></td>
<td>
<p>a kanji (currently only as a single UTF-8 character).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>refdist</code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of the reference distance (currently only "strokedit").</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>refnn</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of nearest neighbors in terms of the reference distance.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>compdist</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector. The name(s) of one or several other distances to compare with
(currently only "kanjidist").</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>compnn</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of nearest neighbors in terms of the other distance(s). If this is
positive it is assumed that the suggested package kanjistat.data is available.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>further parameters that are passed to <code>kanjidist()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix of distances with <code>refnn + compnn</code> columns named by the nearest neighbors of <code>kan</code> (first
in terms of the reference distance, then the other distances) and <code>1 + length(compdist)</code> rows named
by the type of distance.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p><a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental"><img src="../help/figures/lifecycle-experimental.svg" alt="[Experimental]"></a><br>
This is only a first draft of the function and its interface and details may change considerably in the future.
As there is currently no precomputed kanjidist matrix, there is a huge difference in computation time between
setting <code>compnn = 0</code> (only kanji distances to the <code>refnn</code> nearest neighbors in terms of <code>refdist</code> have to be
computed) and setting <code>compnn</code> to any value $&gt; 0$ (kanji distances to all 2135 other Jouyou kanji have to be
computed in order to determine the <code>compnn</code> nearest neighbors; depending on the system and parameter settings
this can take (roughly) anywhere between 2 minutes and an hour).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># compare_neighborhoods("\u6674", refnn=5, compo_seg_depth=4, approx="pcweighted",
#                       compnn=0, minor_warnings=FALSE)
</code></pre>
