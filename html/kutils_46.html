<h2>Convert nothing to R missing(NA).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>By "nothing", we mean white space or other indications of
nothingness.  Goal is to find character strings that users
might insert in a key to indicate missing values. Those things,
which are given default values in the argument nothings, will be
changed to NA.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">n2NA(x, nothings = c("\\.", "\\s"), zapspace = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector. If x is not a character vector, it is
returned unaltered without warning.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nothings</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of values to be matched by regular
expressions as missing.  The default vector is c("\.",
"\s"), where "\." means a literal period (backslashes needed
to escape the symbol which would otherwise match anything in a
regular expression).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>zapspace</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should leading and trailing white space be
ignored, so that, for example " . " and "." are both treated
as missing.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Using regular expression matching, any value that has nothing
except for the indicated "nothing" values is converted to NA.  The
"nothing" values included by default are a period by itself (A SAS
missing value), an empty string, or white space, meaning " ", or
any number of spaces, or a tab.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector with "nothing" values replaced by R's NA symbol.
Does not alter other values in the vector. Previous version
had applied zapspace to non-missing values, but it no longer
does so.
