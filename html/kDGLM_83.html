<h2>Structural blocks for auto regressive trends and regressions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates the structure for a Auto Regressive (AR) block (see West and Harrison (1997), chapter 9) with desired order.
As the package suppose that the structure of the model is linear, a linearization is applied to the evolution equation, as described in West and Harrison (1997), chapter 13.
This block also supports Transfer Functions, being necessary to specify the associated pulse when calling the TF_block function (see arg.).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

  ...,

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Named values for the planning matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>order</code></td>
<td>
<p>Positive integer: The order of the AR block.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>noise.var</code></td>
<td>
<p>Non-negative scalar: The variance of the white noise added to the latent state.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>noise.disc</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector or scalar: The value for the discount factor associated with the current latent state. If noise.disc is a vector, it should have size t and it is interpreted as the discount factor at each observed time. If D is a scalar, the same discount will be used for all observation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pulse</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector or scalar: An optional argument providing the values for the pulse for a Transfer Function. Default is 0 (no Transfer Function).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>String: An optional argument providing the name for this block. Can be useful to identify the models with meaningful labels, also, the name used will be used in some auxiliary functions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>AR.support</code></td>
<td>
<p>String: Either "constrained" or "free" (default). If AR.support is "constrained", then the AR coefficients will be forced to be on the interval (-1,1), otherwise, the coefficients will be unrestricted. Beware that, under no restriction on the coefficients, there is no guarantee that the estimated coefficients will imply in a stationary process, furthermore, if the order of the AR block is greater than 1. As such the restriction of the coefficients support is only available for AR blocks with order equal to 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>h</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector or scalar: A drift to be add in the states after the temporal evolution (can be interpreted as the mean of the random noise at each time). If a vector, it should have size t, and each value will be applied in their respective time. If a scalar, the passed value will be used for all observations.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>a1</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector or scalar: The prior mean for the states associated with this block at time 1. If a1 is a vector, its dimension should be equal to the order of the AR block. If a1 is a scalar, its value will be used for all coefficients.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>R1</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix, vector or scalar: The prior covariance matrix for the states associated with this block at time 1. If R1 is a matrix, its dimensions should be n x n, where n is the order of the AR block. If R1 is a vector or scalar, a covariance matrix will be created as a diagonal matrix with the values of R1 in the diagonal.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>monitoring</code></td>
<td>
<p>bool: A flag indicating if the latent state should be monitored (if automated monitoring is used). The default is TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>D.coef</code></td>
<td>
<p>Array, Matrix, vector or scalar: The values for the discount factors associated with the AR coefficients at each time. If D.coef is an array, its dimensions should be n x n x t, where n is the order of the AR block and t is the length of the outcomes. If D.coef is a matrix, its dimensions should be n x n and the same discount matrix will be used in all observations. If D.coef is a vector, it should have size t and it is interpreted as the discount factor at each observed time (same discount for all variable). If D.coef is a scalar, the same discount will be used for all AR coefficients at all times.</p>

<td><code>a1.coef</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector or scalar: The prior mean for the AR coefficients associated with this block at time 1. If a1.coef is a vector, its dimension should be equal to the order of the AR block.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For the ..., noise.var, noise.disc, D, H, a1, R1, a1, R1, a1.pulse, R1.pulse, D.pulse, h.pulse, H.pulse arguments, the user may set one or more of its values as a string.
By doing so, the user will leave the block partially undefined.
The user must then pass the undefined parameter values as named arguments to the <code>fit_model</code> function. Also, multiple values can be passed, allowing for a sensitivity analysis for the value of this parameter.
