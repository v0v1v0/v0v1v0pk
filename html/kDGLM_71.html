<h2>Structural blocks for regressions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a block for a (dynamic) regression for a covariate X_t.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">regression_block(
  ...,
  max.lag = 0,
  zero.fill = TRUE,
  name = "Var.Reg",
  D = 1,
  h = 0,
  H = 0,
  a1 = 0,
  R1 = 9,
  monitoring = rep(FALSE, max.lag + 1)
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Named values for the planning matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max.lag</code></td>
<td>
<p>Non-negative integer: An optional argument providing the maximum lag for the explanatory variables. If a positive value is provided, this block will create additional latent states to measure the lagged effect of X_t up until the given value. See West and Harrison (1997), subsection 9.2.2 item (3).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>zero.fill</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean: A Boolean indicating if the block should fill the initial delay values with 0's. If TRUE and max.lag is positive, the block assumes that X_t=0 for all t&lt;1. If FALSE, the block assumes the user will provide X_t for all t, such that X_t will have size t+propagation_size</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>String: An optional argument providing the name for this block. Can be useful to identify the models with meaningful labels, also, the name used will be used in some auxiliary functions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>D</code></td>
<td>
<p>Array, Matrix, vector or scalar: The values for the discount factors at each time. If D is a array, its dimensions should be n x n x t, where n is the order of the polynomial block and t is the length of the outcomes. If D is a matrix, its dimensions should be n x n and its values will be used for each time. If D is a vector or scalar, a discount factor matrix will be created as a diagonal matrix with the values of D in the diagonal.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>h</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix, vector or scalar: A drift to be add after the temporal evolution (can be interpreted as the mean of the random noise at each time). If a matrix, its dimension should be 2 x t, where t is the length of the series. If a vector, it should have size t, and each value will be applied to the first latent state (the one which affects the linear predictors) in their respective time. If a scalar, the passed value will be used for the first latent state at each time.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>H</code></td>
<td>
<p>Array, Matrix, vector or scalar: The values for the covariance matrix for the noise factor at each time. If H is a array, its dimensions should be n x n x t, where n is the order of the polynomial block and t is the length of the outcomes. If H is a matrix, its dimensions should be n x n and its values will be used for each time. If H is a vector or scalar, a discount factor matrix will be created as a diagonal matrix with the values of H in the diagonal.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>a1</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector or scalar: The prior mean for the latent states associated with this block at time 1. If a1 is a vector, its dimension should be equal to the order of the polynomial block. If a1 is a scalar, its value will be used for all latent states.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>R1</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix, vector or scalar: The prior covariance matrix for the latent states associated with this block at time 1. If R1 is a matrix, its dimensions should be n x n. If R1 is a vector or scalar, a covariance matrix will be created as a diagonal matrix with the values of R1 in the diagonal.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>monitoring</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector: A vector of flags indicating which variables should be monitored (if automated monitoring is used). Its size should be n. The default is that no variable should be monitored.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For the ..., D, H, a1 and R1 arguments, the user may set one or more of its values as a string.
By doing so, the user will leave the block partially undefined.
The user must then pass the undefined parameter values as named arguments to the <code>fit_model</code> function. Also, multiple values can be passed, allowing for a sensitivity analysis for the value of this parameter.
