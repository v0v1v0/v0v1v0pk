(intergenerational) kinship dispersal kernel. Dispersal distances can be inputted as numeric vectors, or alternatively as objects of classes <code>KinPairData</code>
or <code>KinPairSimulation</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This (with its paired function <code>axpermute_standard</code>) are the core functions implemented in the <code>kindisperse</code> package. They enable the decomposition of the
pedigree &amp; dispersal information contained in the sampled distributions of close kin dyads (full siblings, first cousins, etc.) &amp; its leveraging within an additive dispersal
framework to estimate the key intergenerational (parent-offspring) dispersal parameter of a population. Four key ideas underpin the approach in this function: (a) tracing
dispersal pedigrees to determine the number of complete intergenerational (breeding-cycle-spanning) dispersal events separating the sampled close-kin dyads; (b) using kin categories
that share the same overarching kinship 'phase' to control for residual 'phased' (non-intergenerational) disperal events that occur at the pedigree branch point (e.g. ovipositional
dispersal for full sibling mosquitoes), and (c) using synced or equivalent sampling points to eliminate non-intergenerational dispersal at the branch-tips of the pedigrees, then
finally (d) decomposing the 'pure' pedigree-associated (intergenerational) dispersal into an estimae of the single-generation intergenerational dispersal parameter.
</p>
<p>At its most basic, this function requires information about two dispersal vectors, a &amp; b - both of a phased kinship category, &amp; <code>vector a</code> having a more dispersed pedigree
than <code>vector b</code>. In addition to this initial pair of dispersed kin categories, either one or another matched pair of kin categories can be added:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> A mixture category. This redefines the vector it is paired with (either a or b) so that rather than being considered as a 'pure' pedigree variant, it is considered as mixed with a
different kin category, often of a differing pedigree phase. If used, the other initial vector must also be paired with a related mixture category or composite vector.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A composite dispersal vector. This is defined exactly as the initial dispersal vectors. After calculation, the axial value found is composited with that of the matched initial vector, and
its kinship category redefined as a mixture category as above. If used, the other initial vector must also be paired with a related mixture category or composite vector. These can be paired so
that a mixture category (e.g. first &amp; half-first cousins where these could not be separated with available genetic data) can be counterbalanced with the composition of full sibling &amp; half-sibling
dyads, which (assuming equal mixture) approximately controls for the phasing of the mixed kin categories, enabling an estimate of intergenerational dispersal without exact knowledge of the
composition of the cousins distribution.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each vector or <code>KinPairData</code> / <code>KinPairSimulation</code> object is paired with several other parameters: (1) a logical (e.g. <code>amix</code> delineating whether the category is being
used in the calculation, (2) a category parameter (.e.g <code>acat</code>) defining what kin relationship is being measured, (3) an optional breeding cycle number (e.g. <code>acycle</code>)
showing the number of breeding cycles each member of the kin pair has passed through before being sampled (the cycle vector <code>c(1, 0)</code> corresponds to an adult &amp; a juvenile
being sampled at the same point in the breeding cycle; <code>c(1, 1)</code> represents two adults (i.e. after their first breeding), etc.) . If a <code>KinPairData</code> or
<code>KinPairSimulation</code> object is inputted, all paired parameters that are not explicitly set will default to those contained in the objects (using KinPair objects
is the ideal way to deploy this function).
