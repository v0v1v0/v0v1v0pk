<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Precomputed kanji distances
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pooled_similarity
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A tibble containing kanji similarity judgments by 3 "native or native-like"
speakers of Japanese. For each row, the pivot kanji was compared to a list of
potential distractors. From the distractors, the subjects selected one
character which they found particularly easy to confuse with the pivot. For
the exact methodology, see the original study referenced below.
